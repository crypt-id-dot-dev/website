## What is Crypt-ID?
**Cryptid, noun**: An animal claimed to exist but never proven to exist.

Crypt-ID is a blog dedicated to my work in technology, with an emphasis on privacy, security, and productivity.

I'm deeply passionate about **crypt**ography, **id**entity, and studying the cryptids of the digital world.
