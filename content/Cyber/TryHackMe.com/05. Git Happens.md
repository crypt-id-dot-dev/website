`export ip=10.10.51.156`

# Recon / Enumeration
Starting with a basic port scan: `nmap $ip` 
We find that port 80 is open, so I'll take a look in the browser.

This brings us to a login page:

In the bottom of this page's source, I noticed an unusual and very long script block:

It seems like this could be an obfuscated piece of code, but since I'm not sure what to make of it I'll poke around a bit more first.

With a more comprehensive scan of port 80 (`nmap -sVC -T4 $ip -p80 -oN full_80.nmap`), I discovered /.git/ which seems to expose the .git directory of the webpage repository.

# Exploring /.git /
I downloaded a local copy of the website, including this .git directory using `wget --recursive $ip/.git` and looked through the files for any useful information.

With some [research](https://infosecwriteups.com/exposed-git-directory-exploitation-3e30481e8d75) and looking inside `refs`, I'm learning that we can use git to interactively get information from the repository.

This is an interesting start, but I decided to use [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to get a bit more support in automating this discovery process. (It turns out I didn't really need the features of GitTools here, but it's still good to know about for the future).

After cloning this repo, I had success running `./GitTools/Dumper/gitdumper.sh 10.10.51.156/.git/ dumper_out`

Running `git status` in my newly cloned directory ,`dumper_out`, (which I now realize I could have done without GitTools) I find that the most recent changes deleted several files. We can restore these files with `git checkout -- .`
`README.md` reads this, which makes me think we're heading in the right direction:
```
# git-fail

Sometimes, bad things happen to good sites 
```

Among these restored files, `dashboard.html` has some interesting content, although like the obfuscated string earlier, I'm not sure what to make of it.

I finally decided to take a look at the commit history with `git log`, and I found some very informative commit messages:

I'll checkout the commit before obfuscation with `git checkout 395e087334d613d5e423cdf8f7be27196a360459 .`
Now revisiting `index.html`, we find some credentials hardcoded in the page. Although the web app doesn't actually let us log in, as we saw in `dashboard.html` earlier, we should be able to use the login password as the flag, which finishes the room!

# Closing thoughts
I have a lot of experience using Git for programming projects between personal life and my college coursework, and this was a great way to reinforce that knowledge with a new goal. It has me considering a few ideas including the significance of permanence online, having good security from the start (the concept of secure by design vs bolted on security), and perhaps being a little more subtle with commit messages!
